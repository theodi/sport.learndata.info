A good example of this is the online MusicBrainz database that hosts the world&#39;s largest open encyclopedia of music data. This data is consumed by spotify who combine it with their own data in order to provide a music platform to their consumers. In this scenario MusicBrainz see a use of their data, but no benefit is returned.</p>",

This may present challenges when trying to open up the data for others to use as platform providers may be reluctant to do this, feeling it would impact on their business. The OpenActive project is working with platform providers to help overcome this challenge. Another option is to build open data into contracts with the platform providers, meaning that it has to be made available. This is a practice being adapted within Governments and more can be discovered in this eLearning module on the <a href=\"https://www.europeandataportal.eu/elearning/en/module4\" target=\"_blank\">European Data Portal</a>.</p><p>The other major challenge in opening up data is the perceived lack of control over the subsequent data usage. For the activity providers, not being able to control the flow of data could be seen as a risk, however think of the case for releasing data on the locations of cash points. If the banks refused to do this, how would you find out if a cash point was genuine?</p><p>Clearly however the biggest potential from opening up opportunity data is the potential to increase the numbers of people being active.
